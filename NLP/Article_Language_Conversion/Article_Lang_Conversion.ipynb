You can now use Meta AI on these platforms to get things done, learn, create and connect with the things that matter to you. Built with Meta Llama 3, Meta AI is one of the world’s leading AI assistants, already on your phone, in your pocket for free across more than a dozen countries.\n",

Imagine is their text-to-image generation capability that will let users spark their creativity. “You can create a customized fun invite for your kid’s birthday party or riff with your friends to create fun images. And it doesn’t stop there. Found an image you love? Ask Meta AI to animate it or iterate on the image with friends by asking Meta AI to change the prompt” read the statement.\n",
