# English to Hindi Article Translator

## Overview

This project provides a web-based application for translating articles from English to Hindi using machine learning models. The application utilizes Hugging Faceâ€™s MarianMT model for translation and leverages Gradio to create an interactive web interface for users to input URLs of articles and receive translations.

## Features

- **Article Extraction**: Extracts article content from a provided URL using `newspaper3k`.
- **Language Detection**: Detects the language of the extracted article.
- **Translation**: Translates English articles to Hindi using MarianMT from Hugging Face.
- **Summarization**: Summarizes the translated article.
- **Evaluation**: Provides BLEU, ROUGE, and TER scores to evaluate translation quality.
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly Gradio interface for easy interaction.

## Installation

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install indic-nlp-library newspaper3k transformers langdetect sentencepiece torch sacrebleu rouge-score pyterrier nltk gradio
```

## Setup

1. **Obtain Hugging Face Token**:
   - Create a Hugging Face token by going to [Hugging Face Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
   - Copy the generated token.

2. **Add Token to Colab Secrets**:
   - Open your Google Colab notebook.
   - Navigate to the **Secrets** section.
   - Add a new secret with the name `HF_TOKEN` and paste your Hugging Face token in the value field.
   - Restart the Colab runtime.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**:
   - Open the provided script in Google Colab or your preferred Python environment.
   - Execute the code to start the Gradio interface.

2. **Interacting with the Interface**:
   - Enter the URL of an English article in the input field of the Gradio interface.
   - The translated Hindi article and evaluation metrics will be displayed.


## Evaluation Metrics

The project evaluates the translation quality using the following metrics:

- **BLEU Score**: Measures n-gram overlap between the generated and reference text.
- **ROUGE Scores**: Measures overlap of unigrams, bigrams, and longest common subsequences.
- **TER Score**: Measures the number of edits needed to convert the generated text into the reference text.
